Welcome to my image editing program! Here you will be able to change photos and
make it look as if they were taken 100 years ago!

This code has not been tested on windows as it was created on a linux machine, please
use Cloud9 or a linux distro if you run into issues on Windows.

DISCLAIMER: Some people have run into issues regarding files with .gif extensions. This can be a problem with the PIL library.
Some environments have been able to convert it, although the image resulted is black and white.
Other environments have run into errors with the python code causing errors.

Two texture files have been included in the repository, feel free to test both of them out. 

Enjoy your images being transformed!
